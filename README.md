## Overview
The Customer Reviews Analysis Based Recommendation System of Smartphones is a project aimed at providing users with personalized smartphone recommendations based on sentiment analysis of customer reviews.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Calculated sentiment scores for each review using a formula derived from research.
